# Blockchain Based Voting System

## Overview

The Blockchain-Based Voting System is an ongoing decentralized application (DApp) that leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof platform for conducting elections. This repository contains all the necessary components to set up, deploy, and utilize the system effectively.

## Introduction

Traditional voting systems are often plagued with issues related to security, transparency, and trust. The Blockchain-Based Voting System aims to address these challenges by utilizing blockchain's inherent properties to ensure that each vote is securely recorded and cannot be altered or tampered with.

This DApp provides a user-friendly interface for voters to cast their votes.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the System's user interface:

## Features

- **Security:** Utilizes blockchain cryptography to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of votes.
- **Transparency:** Every vote cast is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable audit trail.
- **Decentralization:** The absence of a central authority prevents single points of failure or manipulation.
- **Double Voting Prevention:** Smart contracts are designed to prevent users from casting multiple votes.
- **Real-time Results:** Enables real-time tracking of election results as votes are cast.

## How It Works

1. Voters and candidates are registered through the DApp interface.
2. Voters can cast their votes, which are then securely recorded on the blockchain.
3. Smart contracts handle the validation and recording of votes.
4. Real-time vote tallies are accessible to everyone.
5. Once the voting period ends, smart contract closes the voting and the final results is displayed.

## Technology Stack

- Ethereum Blockchain
- Solidity Smart Contracts
- Metamask for Wallet and Transactions
- Volta Testnet
- React.js for the User Interface

## Upcoming:

We are actively working on integrating fingerprint authentication into our voting system. This will add an extra layer of security and ease of use for voters. Keep an eye out for updates on this exciting feature!
